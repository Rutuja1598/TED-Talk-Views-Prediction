# TED-Talk-Views-Prediction
In an age where knowledge-sharing has become increasingly important, TED, a nonprofit organization founded in 1984, stands as a beacon for the dissemination of innovative and inspiring ideas. TED's mission is to connect experts across various fields, be it Technology, Entertainment, or Design, with a global audience. Over the years, it has hosted talks by luminaries such as Al Gore, Jimmy Wales, Shahrukh Khan, and Bill Gates. As of 2015, TED, along with its associated TEDx chapters, had made over 2000 talks available for free to the public, making it a vital resource for intellectual enrichment.

The core objective of this project is to construct a predictive model that can estimate the number of views a TED talk will garner once uploaded to the TEDx website. This predictive model carries significant implications for TED as it helps the organization better understand the factors influencing the popularity of its talks and provides insights into how to engage its audience more effectively.
